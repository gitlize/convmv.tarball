1.06
- fix some typos and cosmetics
- add missing from_print
- rewrote checkenc(), no more false alarms now with "encodings" like MIME-Q, which can look quite different. As a side effect error messages became more detailed

1.05
- --qfrom/to also mask cntrl characters now
- symlink printout splitted to get correct output
- missing $arg in symlink fixed (bug introduced in 1.02)
- add NFS4 issues to documentation
- add test suite
- add file length check

1.04
- add --exec option to allow arbitrary operations

1.03
- add --lowmem option to keep memory footprint low when millions of files are being converted. However this will deactivate symlink target checks.
- add Samba issues to documentation
- suppress normalization error messages in cases of invalid UTF-8 in checkenc()

1.02
- make default behaviour to not work recursively so we can convert a single directory, use -r to get the old (recursive) mode
- work around find() oddity, which doesn't process directories from @ARGV
- die on unknown option
- check if files exist and die otherwise

1.01
- documentation updates
- check if symlink target is -f or -d, we run into problems in /proc otherwise.
- implement interactive (-i) mode

1.0
- UTF-8 smartness added

0.3
- first stable release
