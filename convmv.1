by default convmv will detect is a filename is already \s-1UTF\-8\s0 encoded and will skip this file if conversion from some charset to \s-1UTF\-8\s0 should be performed. \-\-nosmart will also force conversion to \s-1UTF\-8\s0 for such files, which might result is \*(L"doulbe encoded \s-1UTF\-8\s0\*(R" (see section below).

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBconvmv\fR is meant to help convert a directory tree and the contained files or a whole filesystem into a different encoding. It just converts the filenames, not the content of the files. A special feature of convmv is that it also takes care of symlinks, also converts the symlink target pointer in case the symlink target is being converted, too.
.PP
All this comes in very handy when one wants to switch over from old 8bit locales to \s-1UTF\-8\s0 locales. It is also possible to convert directories to \s-1UTF\-8\s0 which are already partly \s-1UTF\-8\s0 encoded. convmv is able to detect if certain files are \s-1UTF\-8\s0 encoded and will skip them by default. To turn this smartness off use the \-\-nosmart switch.
.PP
An interoperability issue that comes with \s-1UTF\-8\s0 locales is this: Linux and (most?) other Unix-like operating systems use the so called normalization form C (\s-1NFC\s0) for its \s-1UTF\-8\s0 encoding by default but do not enforce this. Darwin, the base of the Macintosh \s-1OS\s0 enforces normalization form D (\s-1NFD\s0), where a few characters are encoded in a different way. convmv is able to convert files to \s-1NFC\s0 or \s-1NFD\s0 which makes interoperability to such systems a lot easier.
.Sh "How to undo double \s-1UTF\-8\s0 (or other) encoded filenames"
.IX Subsection "How to undo double UTF-8 (or other) encoded filenames"
Sometimes it might happen that you \*(L"double\-encoded\*(R" certain filenames, for example the file names already were \s-1UTF\-8\s0 encoded and you accidently did another conversion from some charset to \s-1UTF\-8\s0. You can simply undo that by converting that the other way round. The from-charset has to be \s-1UTF\-8\s0 and the to-charset has to be the from-charset you previously accidently used. You should check to get the correct results by doing the conversion without \-\-notest before, also the \-\-qfrom option might be helpful, because the double-encoded file names might screw up your terminal if they are being printed \- they often contain control sequences which do funny things with your terminal window. If you are not sure about the charset which was accidently converted from, using \-\-qfrom is a good way to fiddle out the required encoding without destoying the file names finally.
